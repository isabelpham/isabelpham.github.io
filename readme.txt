--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, 
particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require 
it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting 
the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. 
We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. 
If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. 
But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas 
and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

14/14
- 1/1 Readme
- 3/3 Basic HTML content
- 3/3 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 3/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 + 1 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
Basic HTML features I have are:
- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s) on my project, home, and about section. 
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text on every page.
- Links to external page(s) on wireframes and contact links on icons.
- Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between home and about. There is also a "see project" button that skips to the project
section, along with the back to top that allows you to auto scroll to the top of the home page. 


(b) CSS features
Basic CSS styling I have are:
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the Resources section.
I changed everything to a dark brown color and the color changed when you hover the pages on the navigation bar. 
- Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality (make sure to include appropriate fallbacks)

(c) Advanced features
Advanced features I have:
- Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
For this assignent, I started on it when the assignment was released. Working on it 2 to 3 hours a 
day allows me to to have free time on the weekend to do other homework and spend time with family.
I have also fondle with Adobe illustrator to make the graphics for the page as well. Some things I made were
the logo, covers, and background picture for my work page. In total, I have spent around 17 hours on this project
researching, coding, and illustrating. 

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
- Bootstrap for responsive design: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/
- W3W for basic html/css , postioning, alignment, and padding tutorials: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_align-content.asp
- https://cofolios.com for inspriation for portfolio 

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
When working on this assignment, I have discuss units usages with Cole Schiffer. I didn't understand the difference between em and px
in class, but the professor explained it and cleared confusion. I also asked him to test and interact my portfolio to make sure that 
my website is responsive. 

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
