        <p class="bodyText">This case study was created in Spring 2021 Design at UCI’s Project Teams. ​​​​​​​Finding a safe space for women that includes advice and information varies across different platforms, resulting in difficulties when finding specific information. Even if that platform does provide these resources, users often have to pay a subscription to join. EmpowHer is an application that provides a platform for women to educate or empower other women through event webinars and forums. </p>

Two of the main features we were looking to include were creating a community forum for users and providing useful resources. We checked these applications to see their functions, see what they lacked, and improve it in our application.</p>

              To further understand how the application can maximize a good experience for users, we asked for suggestions on what helpful features should be implemented to the applications that have not been mentioned yet. 
              Unique suggestions that we took into consideration were a quiz that suggests a specific pet that accommodates potential owners’ lifestyles based on their answers. A feature to screen pet businesses to decrease the chances of working with an untrustworthy unethical breeder or adoption center.

          <p class="bodyText">We collectively built an empathy map by brainstorming some of the feelings, goals, tasks, influences, and pain points of users. This helped influence our creation of user personas by highlighting the user’s potential needs. For example, when building the empathy map, we realized one of the most major goals of EmpowHer is for users to meet and talk to people with similar experiences as them which was then emphasized greatly as a need and goal in both of the personas. One pain point we ran into was the possibility of people getting offended or triggered due to the discussion of a sensitive topic, which prompted us to include the tagging feature within forum posts so that users can filter out topics that may trigger or upset them.</p>

            With Covid restrictions being mandated, it is difficult to find a safe space to learn about rights or other information that is not through in school or parents. Also, it limits the resources women get access to find their community and support one another. With all of these conflicting elements during the hard times of the pandemic, it can decrease women’s mental health or put them at risk because of the lack of knowledge.

            If a user is interested in one of the events, they can signup through our event page. To keep them engage in the community, we created a forums page called "Join the Talk" that allows users to post questions or concerns they might have and give other users who have the information for the topic a chance to answer them.</p>

  <p class="bodyText">Due to a time limit resulting in us having to pick a topic we were not familiar with, we felt like more time should’ve been spent on solidifying our idea and settling on the right idea before we created the survey. 
    On topics that we are not familiar with, it is important to do a lot of research before designing the application; research helped us understand why we were doing this and how to make our design more effective. 
    Another thing I learned was that brainstorming together on the user flow helped us be on the same page. The next steps for EmpowHer are to conduct more usability testing because we only tested our mid-fidelity; we hope that more testing will resolve most of our potential issues. 
    During the time of creating this case study, we were planning to create a static website, due to time constraints, we were not able to do so-- we plan on creating that in our next steps as well. Lastly, we hope to publish the website and market it to relevant communities, hoping to help them.
